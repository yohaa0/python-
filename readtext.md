## Introduction

Author: yohaa0

It's based on the [FullScreenWrapper2: An Python SL4A GUI framework for Android](http://srinathh.github.io/opensource/fullscreenwrapper/)

## We need your help
It could be ported to QPython3 easily. You can try to port qsl4ahelper-qpython2 to qpython3 first. That will be great if you are interested in helping this.
